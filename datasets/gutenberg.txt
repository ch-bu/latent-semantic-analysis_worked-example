In cognitive psychology, cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.
Cognitive load theory was developed out of the study of problem solving by John Sweller in the late 1980s.
Sweller argued that instructional design can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.
Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.
