In cognitive psychology, cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.
Cognitive load theory was developed out of the study of problem solving by John Sweller in the late 1980s.
Sweller argued that instructional design can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.
Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed  alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.
Beer is brewed from cereal grains â€” most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.
Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent.
Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops.
In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.
Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.
